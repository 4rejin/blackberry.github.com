Vorbis is a free software / open source project headed by the [Xiph.Org](http://xiph.org) Foundation. The project produces an audio format specification and software implementation (codec) for lossy audio compression. Vorbis is most commonly used in conjunction with the Ogg container format and it is therefore often referred to as Ogg Vorbis.  More information at [Vorbis.com](http://vorbis.com).
